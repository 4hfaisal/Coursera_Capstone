        "A company would like to try a new pizza parlors concept . The new concept is to target customers interested in paying a monthly or annual subscription fees and then be able to get any number of pizza slices and drinks from the new pizza parlors. \n",
        "To test the concept, the company would like to place several (3-5) pizza parlors around the city centers of either Toronto or Montreal. Having multiple parlors oppenning all at the same time is crucial to establishing  the brand and give comfort to customers that they can utilize their subscription full if they visitors or dwellers of either of these two city centers.\n",
        "The marketing team is conducting multiple assessments and studies related to this concept and whether Toronto or Montreal would be more suitable for the trail launch.  One assessment that they are interested is to know the concentration of Pizza places in the two cities and potential locations where the new concept parlors can be launched. \n",
        "Further discussion with the marketing team on the statement problem, resulted in the following definition of the problem statement. Identify the city where the median distance between existing food venues and other Pizza places is higher.  Then plot the infomraiton on a map to identify food venues that are farthest from Pizza places where the marketing team hypothesizes that lower competition will allow for better placement of the new concept parlors.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Data\n",
        "The Foursqaure API will be used to acquire information about the venues in the city centers of both cities. The two most critical information is the geographical coordinates of the venues and the category/type of the venue. The geographical coordinates will be used for the venues to caluclate the median distance between each venue and all Pizza places in the city center. Finally, the map data (tile sets) will be provided using the Folium package. "
